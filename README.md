# Wilson Library

Description:
The University of La Verne uses a platform called LibGuides to give librarians an easy way to create basic webpages, however they are limited in functionality and design. Therefore, I was extremely proud to develop a fully custom front-end that is dynamically applied to every LibGuide to improve user experience, and give it a more modern design; all while maintaining the ease of usability for librarians to create webpages. This project is meant to replicate the header, hero, & footer from library.laverne.edu in order to implement these sections into all University of La Verne LibGuides while maintaining librarian generated content in between the header and footer.
